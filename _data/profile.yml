    description: Eviction is a leading cause of housing instability in California cities, yet many strategies to prevent and reduce evictions lack empirical footing. Using data on LA County eviction filings, this paper empirically examines how court-based procedural policies impact eviction. I show that reforms to the number of courts may only have limited effects on eviction outcomes. The findings highlight the need for both short-term and long-term strategies to address the eviction and affordable housing crises.
